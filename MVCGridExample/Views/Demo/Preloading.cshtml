<h2>@ViewBag.Title</h2>

<p>With preloading turned on, the initial ajax call is not needed and the data will be loaded when the page loads. Subsequent calls are done with ajax.</p>
<p>Preloading is on by default. Below is an example of a grid with preloading turned off. If you refresh the page, you should see that an initial ajax call is made to load the table for the first time.</p>
